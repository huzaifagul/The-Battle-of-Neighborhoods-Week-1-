# The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods-Week-1-

# Problem & Background
This final project explores the similarity or dissimilarity in aspects from a tourist point of view regarding food, accommodation, beautiful places, and many more. We will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in New York City and Toronto, as they are famous places in the world. They are diverse in many ways. Both are multicultural as well as the financial hubs of their respective countries. 


# Data Description
For this problem, we’ll clean the data, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format. Once the data is in a structured format, will get the services of Foursquare API to explore the data of two cities, in terms of their neighborhoods. The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, theaters, art galleries, museums and many more. We’ll select one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods. Manhattan from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto. We will use k-means clustering algorithm to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. Finally, we’ll use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in cities and their emerging clusters.
This will help to locate the tourist’s areas and hubs, and then we can judge the similarity or dissimilarity between two cities on that basis.
